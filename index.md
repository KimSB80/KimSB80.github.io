### [Impact of Urban Greenspace Access on Longevity](https://github.com/KimSB80/Predicting-Longevity-Using-Urban-Greenspace-)
Studies have linked access to urban greenspace (e.g. parks, gardens) to mental well-being; over the past few years, London’s local government has been making a push for “greening London”. I analyzed data from the Greater London Authority to investigate which well-being metrics, including access to greenspace, are associated with a longer life-span. A gradient boosting model performed best (MAE of 0.796) in determining which factors are most important for longevity within the London wards.

### [Camera Trap Image Analysis Using a Deep Neural Network](https://github.com/KimSB80/Wildlife-Image-Processing)
Deep learning can aid in analyzing the vast amounts of image data created by camera traps, which are used for monitoring wildlife populations for conservation and management purposes. I used a convolutional neural network for multi-class image identification of Himalayan birds. The best model was a fine-tuned VGG16 pre-trained model.
