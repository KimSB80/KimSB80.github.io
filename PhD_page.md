## Effect of Thermal Stress on Juvenile Salmonids (PhD Work)

River temperatures on dammed rivers such as the Klamath River in northern California can reach very high temperatures (> 23C) during summer months. These high water temperatures are physiologically stressful for juvenile salmonids and other fish species.  
 <br>
I used R to filter and analzye a large heterogeneous dataset from multiple original data sources, including fish body temperatures and diet. I then used logistic mixed-effects modeling and AIC model selection to select the best model to predict fish habitat use. Water temperature in the mainstem river was the most important predictor of fish moving into coldwater refuges created by tributaries. Fish also tended to use coldwtaer refuges more at night, and further research indicated that they were moving into the hotter river to forage during daytime. 
<br>
This study highlights the importance of thermal refuges as critical habitat, as rising temperatures across ecosystems exacerbate the effects of an already altered landscape. <br>
