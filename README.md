### Improving urban planning by directing resources to the correct areas
Urban planning organizations need to know where best to allocate resources in working to improve the quality of life in cities. There has been a recent push to emphasize development of urban greenspace, which is linked to mental well-being. I analyzed an urban well-being dataset from the Greater London Authority and used a gradient boosting regression model to predict (MAE of 0.796) the importance of urban greenspace on longevity.

# [Multi-Class Image Detection of Camera Trap Wildlife Imagery](https://github.com/KimSB80/Wildlife-Image-Processing)
### Utilizing the power of deep learning to automate wildlife image analysis 
Deep learning can aid in analyzing the vast amounts of image data created by camera traps, which are used for monitoring wildlife populations for conservation and management purposes. I used a convolutional neural network for multi-class classification of bird images from camera traps. The best model was a fine-tuned VGG16 pre-trained model.
